# Welcome to My Minimal Blog

This is my new personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages. I wanted something simple, clean, and easy to maintain.

## Why This Setup?

- **No build step** - Posts are rendered in the browser
- **Markdown support** - Write in a simple, readable format
- **Minimal design** - Focus on content, not flashy visuals
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting with automatic deployment

## Features

Here's what you can do in your Markdown posts:

1. **Format text** with *italics* or **bold**
2. Create `inline code` or code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
